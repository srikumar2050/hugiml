High Utility Gain Patterns for Interpretable Machine Learning</h1>
<p>The repository provides the source code of a classifier modeling
method (HUG-IML). High Utility Gain-Interpretable Machine Learning
(HUG-IML) is an intrinsic classifier model that extracts a class of
higher order patterns and embeds them into an interpretable learning
model such as logistic regression. The model supports both binary and
multi-class classification problems. The specific details of the HUG-IML
models, benchmark results, and their applications can be referred to in
the IEEE Access paper titled: Interpretable classifier models for
decision support using high utility gain patterns, IEEE Access 2024,
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3455563.</p>

<h3 id="repository-information">1. REPOSITORY INFORMATION</h3>
<p>This repository primarily contains sklearn (scikit-learn.org)
compatible python source files and java programs. The python related
files are used for reading the dataset and invoking standard APIs for
classifier modeling, hyper-parameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
The core data transformations and pattern mining are performed using
java programs. The java programs are invoked directly from the python
program (HUGIMLClassifier.py) and relevant data are exchanged between
programs using binary and text files. A separate output folder is
created to store the generated files.</p>
<p>The overall classifier modeling process workflow is shown in Figure
1.</p>

<p>Top-K High Utility Itemset (THUI) is a Top-K high utility pattern
mining algorithm introduced in the article: Krishnamoorthy, S. (2019).
Mining top-k high utility itemsets with effective threshold raising
strategies. <em>Expert Systems with Applications</em> , <em>117</em> ,
148-165. The core THUI algorithm was built using the SPMF code base
(https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/) distributed under the
GPL v3 license. THUIsl extends the basic version of THUI algorithm and
uses supervised label information for pattern mining. The algorithm
performs data transformations (scaling, discretization, and categorical
encoding), transaction generation with utility information based on
supervised labels, and mines a new class of High Utility Gain (HUG)
patterns that aids the downstream learning task. It also transforms the
training and test data based on the extracted HUG patterns for
interpretable machine learning.</p>

relevant python and java libraries. Refer to the Usage Information
(Option I) below for the actual deployment steps.</p>
<h4 id="data-related-files">1.5 Data related files</h4>
<p>outputs directory: This directory is not part of this shared
repository. It is automatically created during the actual execution of
the program. It will have 3 sub-folders named inpdata, feModels, and
hui. The following files are created in each of these folders during the
program execution. The files created in this ‘outputs’ folder are
automatically deleted by the python program before every classifier fit
operation.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;datasetName&gt;</code>_colNamesNew.bin Contains the column
names generated by the Java program after data transformations. The file
is generated during training stage and subsequently used at the testing
stage.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>outputs/inpdata directory:This directory stores the input data
required for data transformation and utility pattern mining.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;datasetName&gt;</code><em>x</em>{train|test}_{int|float|cat}.bin
The train and test binary data created during the initial python program
execution for subsequent use by Java program for pattern mining. A
maximum of 6 files are created based on the nature of input data
(i.e. based on whether the dataset has integer, float, and categorical
columns)</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;datasetName&gt;</code>_y_train.bin The label (or
outcome) information created during the initial python program execution
at the training stage.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;datasetName&gt;</code>_allColsIdxToName.bin</p>
<p>The column name information generated during the initial python
program execution at the training stage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>outputs/feModels directory:This directory stores the
transformation parameters generated by the HUG-IML model. It uses the
files created in the outputs/inpdata folder while performing
transformations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_ms.bin Min-max scaler data
transformation parameters generated during the training stage by the
Java program.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_kbins.bin K-bins discretizer data
transformation parameters generated during the training stage by the
Java program.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_lb.bin Label binarizer data

extract the learnt parameters and apply them on the test data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>outputs/hui directory: This directory contains the mined utility
patterns and the HUG transformed data matrix.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_util_fs.binThis file contains the
mined utility patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsname&gt;</code>_util_fs_mapped.txt This is a human
readable text file that contains the same set of patterns in the
<code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_util_fs.bin file. While the
<code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_util_fs.bin file contains internally
generated item identifiers, the
<code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_util_fs_mapped.txt file maps the internal
identifiers to the actual column names and discretized bins/categorical
column values.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_tid_sparse.bin This is the
HUG-transformed training data file. It primarily maps the original
training data to the mined pattern space. The dimensionality of this
data matrix (in dense form) will be |size of training data| x |number of
mined patterns|. The actual data is stored and processed in sparse
matrix format. This binary file is read at the python program end for
fitting the final interpretable classifier model (e.g. logistic
regression) on the transformed data.</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_tid_sparse_test.bin</p>
<p>This is the HUG-transformed test data file. It uses the mined
patterns generated during the training stage (stored in
<code>&lt;dsName&gt;</code>_util_fs.bin) and applies it on the test
data. The dimensionality of this matrix (in dense form) will be |size of
test data| x |number of mined patterns|. This binary file is read at the
python program end for final prediction using the fitted model.</p></li>
